## Hi there 👋

I'm Glenn J Lea, a Senior Technical Writer from Canada but based in Berlin, Germany. I have written about technology for over thirty years (since 1993) in industries such as banking and auditing software, wireless chips and modules and consumer facing products. Also, I write the [The Story of Canada Substack](https://glennjlea.substack.com/), a serialized chronological history of Canada from John Cabot and New France to the days of Upper and Lower Canada.
